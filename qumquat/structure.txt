Todo:
    - better tests
    - better docs


Additional library:
 - Hamiltonian simulation via LCU
 - Sparse hamiltonian simulation via graph theory
 - Sum of local terms via Trotter
 - Qubitization?

Additional library:
 - Jordan Wigner transformation
 - Bravyi Kitaev transformation

Docs todo:
- Swap test?
- Basic Grover's, amplitude amplification, the new perp feature
- Other applications of grover: median finding, graph connectivity, minimization, types of mean estimation, dynamic programming, etc? Good exercises?
- phase estimation, approximate counting, estimating energies of hamiltonians
- Shor's algorithm, primarily to test how conven ient the garbage collector is to use
- More of Farhi's QML algorithms
- A demo of the snapshot feature, maybe applied to 1511.02306 to show the accuracy improvement
- Any of Matthew Hastings' many heuristic quantum algorithms for solving constraint satisfaction problems, e.g. last week's 1904.13339
