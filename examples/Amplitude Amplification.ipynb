    "Amplitude amplification is a general technique for converting a quantum state $\\ket{\\text{start}}$ to a quantum state $\\ket{\\text{goal}}$. It works by applying the diffusion operator $G$, which is the product of two reflections about the initial and final state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G = (-1) \\cdot (I - 2\\ket{\\text{start}}\\bra{\\text{start}}) \\cdot (I - 2\\ket{\\text{goal}}\\bra{\\text{goal}})$$\n",

    "Consider the two-dimensional real subspace spanned by $\\ket{\\text{start}}$ and $\\ket{\\text{goal}}$. Two reflections in this space multiplied together give a rotation. In particular, say we have $a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $a^2+b^2 = 1$ such that:\n",
